# go-handlers-template
This is a handlers template for a Go project

## Problem
Everytime I start doing a project in Go, it takes a significant amount of time to handlers the entire project. So, I am not able to concentrate on doing the project itself.

## Solution
I have created this repository as a starter template for Go project, to save time in setting up the project itself. I have saved myself a significant amount of time

## Features
 - App configuration to enhance speed and performance
 - Template Cache to save template load time
 - Option to use template cache or not using boolean value in app config
 - App configuration access to all packages via an access.go file in each package that requires it.
 - Distributed file system for each functionality.
